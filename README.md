## Requirements

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```

> CocoaPods 1.0.0+ is required to build sdlrkx 0.1.0+.

To integrate sdlrkx into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'sdlrkx', '~> 0.11'
```

Then, run the following command:
